# About Me

I am a young professional in training, currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I have a great passion for the technology field and a strong discipline for seeking knowledge and continuously developing myself. I have experience in dealing with the public and working in teams, skills acquired in previous jobs, which allow me to collaborate efficiently in collaborative environments.

I am familiar with the data field, thanks to my previous internship, where I worked daily with tools such as Python, MySQL, and Power BI. This experience helped me develop skills to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effectively. My goal is to learn as much as possible, not only to improve myself as a professional but also to contribute significantly to the company I work for, helping to solve problems and implement improvements.

Committed to excellence and with a mindset focused on continuous growth, I seek to overcome challenges and adapt to new scenarios, always with a focus on adding value and achieving impactful results.
